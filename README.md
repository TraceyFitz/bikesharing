Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis is to ascertain the feasibility of a bike share business in De Moine, Iowa to pitch to investors byt analyzing Citibike data for New York City.

Results:
1. In the trips by wek day per hour visual and based on the data provided the highest volume of trips occur during commuting hours 7 am - 9 am and 5 pm - 7 pm.
2. In the Checkout Times for Bikess visual and bassed on the data provided it is clear most trips are very short in nature. Most being under 30 minutes. 
3. In the Checkout Times Per Hour by Gender and based on the data provided we can see men are the primary users of biking sharing services. 
4. The Trips by Gender Weekdays visual only confirms this point. 
5. Finally, in the Subscriber vs Customer visual, we can see the majority of users are subscribers not once off customers (a.k.a. tourists). Even though our entrepreneurs discovered this service while on vacation, it would seem most users are New Yorkers and not out of towners. Although this could be an opportunity for expansion byt partnering with local hotels to offer the service. 

Summary: Based on the information provided it would appear bike sharing is primary used by males to commute to and from work. This makes sense given NYC's traffic and public transportation congestion. Does De Moies share the same issues with traffic and congestion? That would definitely be something work looking into. 

There could be untapped opportunities in the female market, as well as tourists. I would suggest targeting advertsing and partnering with hotels in the area to promote/offer this service.  

Lastly, I'd like to see somee of the most import information, the financials. How much are subsribers vs customers charged? What are the overhead expenses - bikes, maintenance, staff, advertising, etc. Without this information it is impossible to determine if this is a viable business opportunity for De Moines Iowa.
